As one of the two anchor cities for <strong>Soma Education Canada</strong>, the official Canadian ELDOA certification body, Montreal serves as a major training hub where new practitioners are trained and certified. The city's bilingual community has a natural connection to the method — ELDOA was created by French osteopath <strong>Dr. Guy VOYER</strong>, and much of the original methodology and instruction was developed in French.</p><p>The Francophone community in Quebec was among the first in North America to embrace ELDOA and myofascial stretching, with practitioners integrating the method into physiotherapy clinics, sports conditioning centers, and wellness studios across the city. From the Plateau to Westmount, Montrealers have access to practitioners who specialize in spinal decompression, fascial work, and postural correction.</p>",
      "whyPopular": "<p>Montreal's athletic culture and active lifestyle make it a natural fit for ELDOA. The city's long winters drive demand for indoor movement practices that address the postural strain of cold-weather living — think hunched shoulders, tight hip flexors from sitting, and lower back pain from icy sidewalks. ELDOA's targeted spinal decompression exercises offer relief without medication or surgery.</p><p>The city is also home to world-class athletes and sports organizations that have embraced fascial training and myofascial stretching as part of their performance and recovery protocols.</p>",
